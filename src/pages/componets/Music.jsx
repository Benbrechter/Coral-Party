            <p>This body of work is an ongoing exploration of the interconnectedness between the human form and the natural world. Through this collection, I blend human figures into abstracted landscapes to symbolize the inseparability of humanity from nature—despite how easy it is to become distracted or distanced from it in the modern world. Nature sustains us, yet we often turn away from it, just as we sometimes turn away from ourselves.

Each piece uses pointillism as a foundational technique, a style I’m personally drawn to because of my own vision challenges. It allows me to engage in detailed, expansive creation without the need for tools to enhance my sight—letting the work unfold organically through my eye and hand. Unlike traditional pointillism, which relies solely on primary colors and the viewer’s distance to create blends, I use secondary and tertiary colors intentionally to build depth. I also incorporate metallics—copper, silver, gold, and pearl—to interact with light, enriching the visual blending process and bringing the work to life in different lighting conditions.

The first painting, Head in the Clouds, depicts a figure turned away, their head enveloped in cloud. It reflects a period of deep introspection—of feeling detached from myself, even while shining outwardly for others. This piece speaks to escapism: finding beauty in mental landscapes while quietly neglecting my own needs.

The second painting, Of the Tangerine Bristle, portrays the narrative of a relationship. It begins in warmth—orange, pearl, glowing—and evolves into something grounded and home-like. But above it all looms a sky filled with reflective clouds, suggesting an uncertain future. The mirrors in the sky point inward: the unknown will always reveal more of the self. This work holds my sadness and fear around losing someone dear, while also honoring the growth found in facing that darkness.

The third piece in the series is still unfolding, and I’m allowing it the time and space it needs to reveal itself.
